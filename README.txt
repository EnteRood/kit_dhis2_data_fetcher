This plugin prototype runs only in QGIS3 https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

The plugin currently connects to the REST api of https://play.dhis2.org/2.28

Documentation on how to start is in the `./docs https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/kit_dhis2_data_fetcher/tree/master/docs`_ directory

Most important is to create an authentication configuration in QGIS (see docs above) and install the plugin.

In QGIS3 you can install a plugin from a zip, Latest release zip to use in is the `./repo https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/kit_dhis2_data_fetcher/tree/master/repo`_ directory
